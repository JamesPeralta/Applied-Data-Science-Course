    "In this assigment we want to do some basic data analysis on the most popular movies on IMDb right now. We do this in steps: first we take the list of most popular movies then we gather more informaion on each movie from the movie's page. These info are stored in pandas dataframes. Next we need to combine the information from these two tables, using pandas `merge` method. The resulting merged table might give us some insight on why some movies get more popular. Let's try and see what we can get!\n",

    "This problem uses the results of the problem 1. If you can't do Problem 1 for any reason, we have a csv file uploaded on D2L that contains the final result of Problem 1. You can download that file and use `pd.read_csv` to create a dataframe from it. Please note that you need to convert the release date from an string to a datetime object. Also you need to parse the `genres` and `directors` columns into python lists.\n",

Then use pandas aggregation methods to count the movies released in each season of the year. Plot a [bar chart](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/barchart.html#sphx-glr-gallery-lines-bars-and-markers-barchart-py) that shows the average rating of movies made in each season per year for the last **20 years**. Show the 4 seasons of each year next to each other. Use the ticks on X axis to show the year and the colours of the bars to show the season. Also, put a legend on the chart. (10 points)"

Sorting the table before drawing the charts make the slices sorted, try drawing charts for the same data but comment out the line of code you wrote for sorting and see the difference.
